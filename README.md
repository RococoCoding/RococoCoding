<h2>A little about me...</h2>
<h3>Currently</h3>
<p>I'm Alice, a new developer who knows JS, React, Redux, Node, Express and basic Python. I've just graduated from Lambda School, a 6-month intensive coding bootcamp. I'm looking for fully remote roles as a full-stack web dev.
 
<h3>Hire Me!</h3>
<p>I'm reflective, so I'm always looking for lessons to learn and ways to improve so I can be better in the future.
<p>I love to help others and share knowledge. I've mentored other students while in school and always try my best to uplift my teammates.
<p>I'm a creative problem solver. Recently while integrating DocuSign into the Family Promise intake process [frontend](https://github.com/RococoCoding/deprecated-labs31-family-promise-spokane-fe-a) [backend](https://github.com/RococoCoding/deprecated-labs31-family-promise-spokane-be-a), we ran into an issue with DocuSign not accepting cross-origin requests. When we asked the techncial staff at school, we were told the solution, creating a custom CORS gateway, was going to be way above our capabilities. Rather than give up, we came up with a solution where we sent the redirect URL in the response from the backend and had the frontend load that URL. No more CORS issues!

<h3>Facts:</h3>
<p>- Pronouns: She/her</p>
<p>- Age: When I was a child, we had a very fancy electric typewriter before printers became a thing.</p>
<p>- Location: Brooklyn, NY, but willing to relocate anywhere cold. (Bonus points if it's in Finland!)</p>
<p>- My favorite emoji: ðŸ˜…</p>
<p>- The name: One of my favorite projects is [Stacks](https://rocococoding.github.io/stacks/), a library app using vanilla js with search, filter, sort and local save. I built it a month into learning JS. I came up with the name Rococo Code after making it because even back then I could tell it was a bit ... excessive, kind of like [rococo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rococo) architecture, but I'm still proud of it because I think I did a lot with what little I knew back then. For example, I didn't know about the built-in filter method, so I wrote one myself.</p>
<p>- Current pet project: My portfolio needs some fixing up before I'm comfortable showing it off to potential employers.</p>
