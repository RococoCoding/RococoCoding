<h2>A little about me...</h2>
<h3>Currently</h3>
I'm Alice, a web dev student at Lambda School, learning JS, React, Redux, Node and a little bit of Python. I've just finished the first half of React and will be studying advanced React and Redux for November.

My pet side project at the moment is a Pomodoro-type timer to remind me to commit to git more often. I'm also adding a snooze feature so I can finish wrapping up what I'm doing and not forget to reset the timer.

<h3>Why coding?</h3>
I've always been a computer nerd, but never really did much coding beyond a computer applications course in high school. I had been feeling a bit restless the past few years, which resulted in my taking some time off to go to Maine to learn how to build a wooden rowboat??? I didn't know anything about wood or boats or tools, but I'm the kind of person who enjoys diving into new things. What I realized from that experience was that I wanted to make things, but also that I would very, very much wanted to keep all my fingers. Thus, my renewed interest in coding. The timing seemed right when the pandemic hit and it seemed like a pretty good idea to hole myself up in front of a computer for a few months. I was the kid who did logic puzzles for fun, so I'm enjoying it a lot! I love solving problems so I get really in debugging and I love being able to make functional apps that people can use and interact with.
