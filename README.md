# A little about me...
### Elevator Pitch
I'm Alice, a full-stack developer who's experienced in JS/TS, React, Vue, Node/Express, MongoDB and GraphQL. I'm looking for my next position, preferably remote, but open to relocating for in-office. I've been working at a tech-enabled snack food company for the past two years, so I have experience with SMS-based customer relationship management software and online retail. I did a lot of backend work with MongoDB and GraphQL, but I'd like to get experience with SQL.

I believe strongly in teamwork, empathy and supporting the people around you. I'm an easygoing, dependable person who shows up and gets the work done. I enjoy debugging and escorting data to where it needs to be. I focus on the story, not the ticket. If you're looking for someone who fits this bill, you can contact me at alicetchang // gmail.

### Facts:
- Pronouns: She/her  
- Age: Columbia Music House Mail Order Catalog
- Location: Currently nomading, open to relocation. (Bonus points if it's in Finland!)  
- My favorite emoji: ðŸ˜…  
- The name: One of my favorite projects is [Stacks](https://rocococoding.github.io/stacks/), a library app using vanilla js with search, filter, sort and local save. I built it a month into learning JS. I came up with the name Rococo Code after making it because even back then I could tell it was a bit ... excessive, kind of like [rococo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rococo) architecture. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Stenography. I was a court reporter before I learned to code.  

## Current Projects
I started a [blog on Notion](https://wool-art-301.notion.site/Rococo-Coding-ab0dc5f213a24fab903002cae192374e?pvs=4) to talk about my current projects as I work on them.
