# A little about me...
### Brief history: 
- I graduated from University of California, Davis, with a Bachelor of Arts in linguistics and worked as a court reporter for about 10 years, but decided to switch to coding because I wanted to build things and help people solve problems. I joined a bootcamp during COVID lockdowns because it seemed like the perfect time to park myself in front of a computer for several months. After I graduated, I participated in a fellowship program through my bootcamp to intern for a month at Verb Energy, an online retail startup. I was extended an offer of employment after the fellowship, and I stayed there for two years until they shut down the entire engineering department due to the economic downturn this year. 

### Previous experience:
- At Verb I worked in Javascript/Typescript using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) plus Vue and GraphQL, developing for an in-house CRM (customer relationship management) and automating SMS communications and subscription orders using event-driven architecture and workflows, as well as writing scripts. Although my focus was on the backend, I often did the UI for features that I worked on to keep my frontend skills sharp as well.

### Why you should hire me: 
- Quick Learner: I am a quick learner and no stranger to throwing myself in the deep end. From bootcamp to intensive (human) language courses to a three-month wooden boatbuilding workshop when I knew nothing about wood, tools or boats, I've shown an aptitude for learning quickly from scratch.

- Problem solver: I enjoy thinking outside the box and coming at problems from different angles. For instance, at Verb I noticed we had recurring on-call requests regarding people's orders going into limbo due to payment processing errors. I knew we didn't have the bandwidth to implement full support for those payment types, but I took the initiative to look into the relevant code and came up with a quick workaround of automating communication to immediately notify the customer there was an issue and what steps they could take to resolve it. This reduced the load on both customer support and engineering by 3-4 requests per week.

- Team player: I'm a supportive and empathetic teammate. I strongly relate to the idea that everyone has something to contribute, and I believe that teams are strongest when we use our strengths to cover each other's weaknesses. For example, at Verb, when one of my co-workers struggled with on-call, I stepped up to help out so he could focus on the things he was good at. By leaning into our strengths, the team performs better overall.

### What I'm looking for:
- Healthy work culture: If you think the phrase "competitive grind" is a positive, you can pass on me. I treat my teammates as allies, not competitors, and while I chose coding because I enjoy the work, I believe that you have to rest to be your best. I'm also looking for a workplace that is welcoming to all and cares about diversity.
  
- Opportunity to learn: So far in my coding journey I've mostly been focused on learning _how_ to do things, but not _why_. Now that I've solidified my knowledge of Javascript and learned how to do things one way, I think my next phase of learning should focus on why. Why choose one language or framework another? Why is this tech like this? (What problem was it trying to solve?) That's why in my next role I'd like to learn new tech/new ways of doing things so I can get an expanded sense of the possibilities out there and be better able to answer Why?
