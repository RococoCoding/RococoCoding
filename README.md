# A little about me...
### Elevator Pitch
I'm Alice, a full-stack developer who's experienced in JS/TS, React, Vue, Node/Express, MongoDB and GraphQL. I'm looking for my next position, preferably remote, but open to relocating (without assistance) for in-office/hybrid. I have experience with automation workflows, SMS, customer relationship management systems and online retail. I'm eager to learn new tech, particularly getting some professional experience with SQL or non-Mongo databases. I prefer backend work, but can hold my own on the frontend. 

I believe strongly in teamwork, empathy and supporting the people around you. I'm an easygoing, dependable person who shows up and gets the work done. I enjoy debugging and escorting data to where it needs to be. I focus on the story, not the ticket. If you're looking for someone who fits this bill, you can contact me at alicetchang // gmail.
