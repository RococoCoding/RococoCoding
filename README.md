# A little about me...
### Currently
I'm Alice, a full-stack developer who's experienced in JS/TS, React/Redux, Vue, Node/Express, MongoDB and GraphQL. I decided to switch from court reporting to coding because I love solving problems and I want to make things that people can use.

### Facts:
- Pronouns: She/her  
- Age: When I was a child, we had a very fancy electric typewriter before printers became a thing.  
- Location: Brooklyn, NY, but willing to relocate anywhere cold. (Bonus points if it's in Finland!)  
- My favorite emoji: ðŸ˜…  
- The name: One of my favorite projects is [Stacks](https://rocococoding.github.io/stacks/), a library app using vanilla js with search, filter, sort and local save. I built it a month into learning JS. I came up with the name Rococo Code after making it because even back then I could tell it was a bit ... excessive, kind of like [rococo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rococo) architecture.
