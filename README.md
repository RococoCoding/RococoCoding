# A little about me...
### Currently
I'm Alice, a new developer who knows JS, React, Redux, Node, Express and Python. I've just graduated from Lambda School, a 6-month intensive coding bootcamp. I'm looking for roles as a full-stack or backend web dev. I decided to switch from court reporting to coding because I love solving problems and I want to make things that people can use!
 
### Hire Me!
- I'm reflective, so I'm always looking for lessons to learn and ways to improve so I can be better in the future.  
- I love to help others and share knowledge. I've mentored other students while in school and always try my best to uplift my teammates.  
- I'm a creative problem solver. Recently while integrating a third-party API ([frontend repo](https://github.com/RococoCoding/deprecated-labs31-family-promise-spokane-fe-a) | [backend repo](https://github.com/RococoCoding/deprecated-labs31-family-promise-spokane-be-a)), we ran into a CORS issue because the API didn't accept cross-origin requests, which meant it didn't like that our frontend and backend were hosted on different domains. The proper solution would have been to create a custom CORS gateway, but that would have required a big change in how the app was structured. Rather than give up, we came up with a solution where we got the redirect URL from the API, sent it from the backend to the frontend and had the frontend load that URL in a separate function. No more CORS issues!

### Facts:
- Pronouns: She/her  
- Age: When I was a child, we had a very fancy electric typewriter before printers became a thing.  
- Location: Brooklyn, NY, but willing to relocate anywhere cold. (Bonus points if it's in Finland!)  
- My favorite emoji: ðŸ˜…  
- The name: One of my favorite projects is [Stacks](https://rocococoding.github.io/stacks/), a library app using vanilla js with search, filter, sort and local save. I built it a month into learning JS. I came up with the name Rococo Code after making it because even back then I could tell it was a bit ... excessive, kind of like [rococo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rococo) architecture.
